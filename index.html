                        <p class="card-text mt-3">The year is 2008. Geelong just lost one of the most winnable Grand Finals in history, the iPhone was one year old, and a new life was about to start. In Calvery Hospital, Alessio Maiorano was introduced to the world. I was taken home and got to see the rest of my family. In 2010, I got to go to kindergarten for the first time near Influences Church. I made some friends and got to meet some new people when in the middle of my third year of kindergarten, I was taken from there and moved to my first and only school.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">In 2013, I was thrown into the deep end of my schooling life with it being the first year of reception and a new start at Rostrevor College. It was me and 15 other students who had no idea who I was and who they were I felt happy to be at school. A new environment with new faces to meet. It started very shaky with classes being very quiet with the teacher trying to invite people to participate in the class. After some time, I began making new friends who I would invite to birthday parties. It was this year when my dad would start to introduce me to different sports. I could do every sport that the school had to offer but I then chose cricket and AFL. My dad became my cricket coach in year 2 and it was the first time I got to experience how competitive I was. In year 4, I changed sports to play soccer for a year. I did not enjoy it as much as I did with football so in year 5, I changed back to playing football. It was also this year that my musical side started to grow. I was given the trombone and have never regretted that decision again. Music has become one of my favourite subjects while at school and I am involved in the Senior Band and have been a member of that for 2 years. I am the Arts captain for year 10 and I have been in a leadership role before in year 6, I received the Junior School Deputy Music Captain.

                            <h4 class="card-title mt-3">Sports</h4>
                            <p class="card-text mt-3"> I love all sports but especially football and cricket. I started playing football at the early age of 5. This was through the Auskick program that the school ran with the PE department. This was one of my favourite moments as a youngster because this was the first taste that I got of Australian Rules Football, the great game. This passion that I have for AFL has extended through my lifetime supporting the Adelaide Crows since 2014. I played school football and then in 2014, I played my first season at my football club, Hectorville. I love playing at Hectorville playing 115 games for the club and kicking 16 goals in those games. My passion for cricket started in 2013 when I also did the Milo cricket course in reception. This was once again run by the school and the PE department. I enjoyed this a lot and was one of the key reasons why I love the sport. I then played cricket through the school program and then late last year, I played my first season in club cricket. I did not get much of a bowl and would bat at number 9, but I enjoyed it as it was something that I could do on a Sunday for 6 hours each week. Last season, I kept working at the basics to become the opening bowler for our club and took 7 wickets in 8 full matches. I bowled the most overs out of the entire team at 52.4 overs for the season. My coach called me the ‘Bowling Workhorse of the team.’ I was very happy with that, and I have continued to love cricket.

                            <h4 class="card-title mt-3">Hobbies</h4>
                            <p class="card-text mt-3">In my free time, I like to relax on the couch and watch any sports that are on during the day. Whether it be football, soccer, cricket, or tennis, I will watch anything. I like solving puzzles and things that are hands-on and practical whether they be puzzle pieces or twisty puzzles like a Rubik's Cube. Fun fact, I can solve one in under 35 seconds. I also enjoy umpiring and being able to see AFL played from a different perspective. It is my first year as a SANFL Junior Umpire. It is a good way to earn money while staying fit which are two things that I enjoy doing. I enjoy playing video games in my spare time on the weekend as well. These include sports games like FC 24 and 1v1 games like Fortnite.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3">The family that I am a part of is something that I will be ever grateful for and is a positive influence in my life. My mum and dad have sacrificed a lot for me to live the best life possible. They took me to one of the best schools in the state. They have taken me to some of the best places in the world and I will forever thank them for that. My sister is a person who I can turn to whenever I need to get something off of my chest. She is very understanding, and she knows how to calm me down if I am feeling sad or angry. My brother has played an influential role in my life. If I want to play a game whether that be on the PlayStation during a rainy day or to kick the football or play cricket, he is always happy to.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3">My achievements list ranges from on the sporting field, to the classroom and the broader community. In year 3, I won my first best and fairest for school football for being the best player in the season. My dad was there in the front row and was the first person to applaud me. I was very proud of this moment as it was the first time that I was recognized for my efforts in a sport that I love. In year 6, I won the Edmund Rice award for the best man in the year level. I also won the music award for that year as I was the best musical person out of the entire year level. In year 7, I won the Dux of Geography award for being the smartest student in the geography field. I was very shocked at this because I thought that I was not the right person to win the award. In year 9, I won the Dux for Physical Education. I was really happy with this award as I was very consistent in my work and application to the subject. On the sporting side, I have won 3 Coaches Awards for my local club, Hectorville in both football and cricket seasons. I won the most runs scored in a single season this year for the school scoring 163 runs averaging 18 runs and scoring my maiden half-century.

                            <h4 class="card-title mt-3">Values:</h4>
                            <p class="card-text mt-3">My value is that I am a person who will not stop until something is complete. My parents say that I have a very big mouth that I like to be heard and that I will not stop talking. I am very passionate about everything that I do whether that be music, sports, spending time with family and watching the Crows get robbed every single week. I am respectful of everyone that I meet even if I am not the best of friends with them. I still treat them how I would want to be treated: to be heard and respected. I am very honest, and this is showcased through the VIA Character Strengths that I participated in at the start of this year. An example of when honesty has been showcased in my life is when I was 6 and I hit a tennis ball with a cricket bat, and it smashed my mum’s favourite vase. She was very upset with us, and she grounded us both. I thought about it for a couple of days, and I told myself that my brother did not deserve this. So, I told my mum that I had broken the vase and my mum was happy that I told her, and I ended up not getting into more trouble.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3">I would like to extend this to my future identity because this is what makes me myself and this is the version of myself that I would like to continue as it shapes my life now and into the future. The life that I am living is a life that I could not ask for any better. For my life after school, I would like to continue playing the trombone in ensembles and do a university course in Digital Media or music.
